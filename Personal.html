          <div class="abstract">
          The idea of increasing teacher salary to improve student performance has long been a major discussion in education policy. However, there is yet no consensus on the impact of teacher salary on improving student performance. This paper attempts to answer this question by analyzing whether school districts with higher teacher salaries have better student outcomes. By taking school level student performance data from 2003 through 2018, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach that exploits the variation in teacher salaries due to a bargaining effort called ”50K The First Day” that pushed school districts to adopt a salary floor for new ”inexperienced” teachers. We first show how this act increased the difference in salaries between the treated and control groups for not only new teachers but also experienced teachers and find that increases in teacher salary increased student outcomes. We also discuss the mechanism through which these differences could have been observed.
