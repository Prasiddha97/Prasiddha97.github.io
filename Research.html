                This paper examines the impact of increasing teacher salaries on student outcomes by exploiting variation from the “50K The First Day” campaign that established a $50K salary floor for new teachers across New Jersey school districts. Using school-level data from 2003 to 2019, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) approach and first show that the campaign raised salaries for all teachers in New Jersey by approximately $1.5K. Our results indicate that districts implementing the salary increase experienced improvements in 4th grade and high school Math and English Language Arts (ELA) proficiency scores. We also observe modest gains in graduation rate and college enrollment. Analyzing the mechanisms through which these positive effects could have been observed, we rule out teacher migration as a key driver suggesting that the observed improvements are more likely due to changes in teacher motivation and the quality of new teachers entering the profession. Lifting teacher salaries for all teachers—regardless of their performance level—seems to be improving student outcomes in New Jersey.

               U.S. colleges face persistent inequities—not only in who enrolls, but in who ultimately graduates. While institutions have expanded efforts to diversify incoming classes, students from historically underserved backgrounds, including those who are first-generation and low-income, continue to face several barriers which affect their rate of degree completion. This paper evaluates the causal impact of the Bridge Scholars Program (BSP), an eight-week pre-
collegiate summer initiative at Colorado State University designed to support such students
in their transition to college. Leveraging a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD)
within a local randomization inference framework, I find that BSP substantially improves
first-year completion and second-year persistence. While participants receive a $2,500 annual
scholarship, comparative analyses of similar financial aid programs suggest that the bundled
nature of BSP—including structured summer programming, academic mentoring, and peer
support—is central to its effectiveness. These findings underscore the importance of holistic
interventions that address both financial and non-financial barriers to student success. </div>

              The Remote Learning Shock That Wasn’t: STEM Major Choice Resilience During COVID-19 (Under Review. Draft available upon request.)

                This study investigates whether the COVID-19-induced shift to remote learning impacted
undergraduate students’ decisions to remain in or switch into STEM majors. Using longi-
tudinal administrative data from a large U.S. public university (cohorts 2013–2019) and a
staggered difference-in-differences design, I find no meaningful effects of remote instruction
on whether college students remain as STEM majors. Robustness checks, including nearest-
neighbor matching, confirm negligible average effects suggestive that even when assuming
the true estimates are at the upper end of our estimated confidence intervals, the effect is
negligible.. Overall, the evidence suggests that students’ field-of-study choices were largely
resilient to the instructional format change, at least in the short run.              </div>

                Since the first Starbucks store unionized in Buffalo in 2021, over 700 locations have filed for elections, and broader organizing has surged. We examine whether this campaign sparked wider labor activism. Using an event study, we find that counties with a Starbucks election saw nearly six additional non-Starbucks elections on average—accounting for 21% of the post-2021 surge. However, a staggered difference-in-differences design reveals no wage gains for restaurant workers, suggesting that union momentum has not yet shifted bargaining power. Employers may be waiting on the outcome of first contract negotiations before adjusting pay structures.

              How Much Did COVID Impact College Outcomes for High-Schoolers Studying Remote? (Draft available upon request)

                Building upon existing literatures that have shown that COVID had severe negative impacts on high-school outcomes, we can expect COVID to have had some negative repercussions on college outcomes for affected high-school students. This paper answers this question by analyzing whether studying under remote settings in high school had any impacts on college outcomes. Using a standard Differences-in-Differences (DiD) model under a continuous (non-binary) treatment setting, preliminary analysis show no consistent differences in the impact of studying online during high school on college outcomes as measured through college GPA and major choices. Given the results from our study, we argue that more research is needed to analyze how remote learning in high schools affects an individuals’ college outcomes and while conducting such research, future researchers should also take considerable time thinking about the mechanism through which different learning models could induce differing impacts.

                This paper initially started out during my second year of undergraduate when I was taking econometrics and got me interested in time-series analysis. Working on this paper made me 1) think deeply about the many limitations of the study, 2) reflect on the gaps in my knowledge (and thus graduate school!), and 3) finally understand what it actually means when we say "correlation does not imply causation". My research in graduate school has drifted away from this topic but I remain interested in this area. I recognize and regularly follow the many papers economist have published on foreign investment through channels of remittances and as of now, I do not think I have much to contribute to push the needle in this area. Working on this paper also made me realize how to think of non-significant results and whether those results are actually showing negligible effects. It also gave me the very first glimpses into how paper submissions work which for me, as an undergraduate, was interesting to navigate.

                This is an example of a project I was part of for my work at IRISS where we use social network analysis (SNA) to figure out how connections amongst farmers explain their working pattern. The project was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund. A lot of the social network stuff did not end up in this report but I really enjoy working on these type of analysis and hope to incorporate network analysis in my future works. I have had no formal training on SNA's but I think I have picked up a lot of cool things working on different SNA projects at IRISS. I remain interested to see how, and if, SNA's will gain traction in economics research.

                Iowa's farmlands, celebrated for their remarkable agricultural productivity, are facing pressing environmental challenges, including soil erosion, waterway nitrogen pollution, and vulnerability to extreme weather events. These issues imperil the state's agricultural sector's long-term sustainability and economic stability. Despite substantial investments from governmental and non-governmental entities to encourage conservation practice use, adoption rates remain persistently low. In this report, we use quantitative, qualitative, and social network analysis on a sample of 38 farmers to understand how social networks shape their adoption of conservation practices. We analyze data through a systems framework and compare counties with high- and low-adoption of conservation practices to assess influences from the individual farmer level to the broader societal context. We conclude with a discussion of strategic implications to promote conservation adoption.

                This was a project I did as part of CSU Extension. It is an input-output model using data from IMPLAN that looks at the economic impact of the Ute Theatre. The model was developed from scratch and I also administered a survey from start to finish to understand the socio-cultural importance of this historical venue to people of Rifle. In designing the survey flyer and in-person questionnaires, I finally made use of the many hours of my time I spent in high school learning how to use Photoshop. Ex-post, I was humbled to find many free websites online could have probably designed the flyers better.
