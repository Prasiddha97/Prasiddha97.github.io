          <div class="paper-title">What Happens When We Pay Our Teachers More? Evidence from New Jersey Public Schools</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            The impact of teacher salaries on student performance has long been a contentious issue in education policy, and whether higher salaries lead to improved student outcomes remains an open question. This paper investigates whether school districts that pay higher teacher salaries achieve better student performance. Using school-level data from 2003 to 2019, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach to exploit salary variations resulting from a collective bargaining effort that raised the salary floor for new, inexperienced teachers. Our lower-bound estimates indicate that increasing teacher salaries led to a 0.1 standard deviation improvement in student test scores—a larger effect than those reported in comparable studies. We also explore the mechanisms underlying this result, offering insights into how changes in teacher pay may have contributed to improved student outcomes. Finally, we estimate that the cost of these salary increases could be financed by raising per-pupil spending by $200, with the improvements associated with higher teacher salaries exceeding those observed from increasing spending on other factors.

          <div class="paper-title">Bridging the Gap to Access? Impact of Pre-Collegiate Summer Program on College Outcomes</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            U.S. colleges have an inequity problem and even when minority students do attend college, African Americans and Hispanic/Latino students have been found to be two of the most under-performing groups. In that regard, several colleges have adopted several strategies to first increase the diversity of the students in their college and second to ensure these students end up successfully graduating from college. This paper looks at one such program carried out by the Access Center at Colorado State University called the Bridge Scholars Program - a program designed to assist students, especially those from first-generation and limited income households, in making a successful transition to college by offering an eight-week summer program the summer before they start their first year. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRDD) approach under a local randomization assumption, we find positive effects of the program on several college outcomes. We also discuss the mechanism through which such observed positive effects occur.

          <div class="paper-title">How Much Did COVID Impact College Outcomes for High-Schoolers Studying Remote?</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            Building upon the existing literature that has shown that COVID had negative impacts on high-school outcomes, we can expect COVID to have had some negative repercussions on college outcomes of affected high-school students as well. This paper answers the question by analyzing whether studying under remote settings in high school had any impacts on college outcomes. Using a standard Differences-in-Differences (DiD) model, we find no consistent differences in the impact of studying online during high school on college outcomes as measured through college GPA and major choices. Given the results from our study, we argue that more research is needed to analyze how remote learning in high schools affects an individuals’ college outcomes and while conducting such research, future researchers should also take considerable time thinking about the mechanism through which different learning models could induce differing impacts.

          <div class="paper-title">Impact of remittances on economic growth in Nepal</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This paper initially started out during my second year of undergraduate when I was taking econometrics and got me interested in time-series analysis. There is a fair share of amateurish writing in the paper but working on this paper made me realize the many limitations of the study, and what it actually means when we say "correlation does not imply causation". My research in graduate school has drifted away from this but I remain interested in this area. I recognize and regularly follow the many papers economist have published on foreign investment through channels of remittances and as of now, I do not think I have much to contribute to push the needle in this area. Working on this paper also made me realize how to think of non-significant results and whether those results are actually showing negligible effects. It also gave me the very first glimpses into how paper submissions work which for me, as an undergraduate, was interesting to navigate.

          <div class="paper-title">Agricultural conservation networks in Iowa</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This is an example of a project I was part of for my work at IRISS where we use social network analysis (SNA) to figure out how connections amongst farmers explain their working pattern. The project was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund. A lot of the social network stuff did not end up in this report but I am really enjoy working on these type of analysis and hope to incorporate network analysis in my future works. I have had no formal training on SNA's but I think I have picked up a lot of cool things working on different SNA projects at IRISS. I remain interested to see how, and if, SNA's will gain traction in economics research.

            Iowa's farmlands, celebrated for their remarkable agricultural productivity, are facing pressing environmental challenges, including soil erosion, waterway nitrogen pollution, and vulnerability to extreme weather events. These issues imperil the state's agricultural sector's long-term sustainability and economic stability. Despite substantial investments from governmental and non-governmental entities to encourage conservation practice use, adoption rates remain persistently low. In this report, we use quantitative, qualitative, and social network analysis on a sample of 38 farmers to understand how social networks shape their adoption of conservation practices. We analyze data through a systems framework and compare counties with high- and low-adoption of conservation practices to assess influences from the individual farmer level to the broader societal context. We conclude with a discussion of strategic implications to promote conservation adoption.

          <div class="paper-title">Economic Impact of Ute Theatre in Garfield County, Colorado</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This was a project I did as part of CSU Extension. It is an input-output model using data from IMPLAN that looks at the economic impact of the Ute Theatre. The model was developed from scratch and I also administered a survey from start to finish to understand the socio-cultural importance of this historical venue to people of Rifle. In designing the survey flyer and in-person questionnaires, I finally made use of the many hours of my time I spent in high school learning how to use Photoshop. Ex-post, I was humbled to find many free websites online could have probably designed the flyers better.
