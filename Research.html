          <div class="paper-title">Impact of remittances on economic growth in Nepal</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This paper initially started out during my second year of undergraduate when I was taking econometrics and got me interested in time-series analysis. Working on this paper made me 1) think deeply about the many limitations of the study , 2) reflect on the gaps in my knowledge (and thus graduate school!), and 3) finally understand what it actually means when we say "correlation does not imply causation". My research in graduate school has drifted away from this topic but I remain interested in this area. I recognize and regularly follow the many papers economist have published on foreign investment through channels of remittances and as of now, I do not think I have much to contribute to push the needle in this area. Working on this paper also made me realize how to think of non-significant results and whether those results are actually showing negligible effects. It also gave me the very first glimpses into how paper submissions work which for me, as an undergraduate, was interesting to navigate.

          <div class="paper-title">Agricultural conservation networks in Iowa</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This is an example of a project I was part of for my work at IRISS where we use social network analysis (SNA) to figure out how connections amongst farmers explain their working pattern. The project was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund. A lot of the social network stuff did not end up in this report but I really enjoy working on these type of analysis and hope to incorporate network analysis in my future works. I have had no formal training on SNA's but I think I have picked up a lot of cool things working on different SNA projects at IRISS. I remain interested to see how, and if, SNA's will gain traction in economics research.

            Iowa's farmlands, celebrated for their remarkable agricultural productivity, are facing pressing environmental challenges, including soil erosion, waterway nitrogen pollution, and vulnerability to extreme weather events. These issues imperil the state's agricultural sector's long-term sustainability and economic stability. Despite substantial investments from governmental and non-governmental entities to encourage conservation practice use, adoption rates remain persistently low. In this report, we use quantitative, qualitative, and social network analysis on a sample of 38 farmers to understand how social networks shape their adoption of conservation practices. We analyze data through a systems framework and compare counties with high- and low-adoption of conservation practices to assess influences from the individual farmer level to the broader societal context. We conclude with a discussion of strategic implications to promote conservation adoption.

          <div class="paper-title">Economic Impact of Ute Theatre in Garfield County, Colorado</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This was a project I did as part of CSU Extension. It is an input-output model using data from IMPLAN that looks at the economic impact of the Ute Theatre. The model was developed from scratch and I also administered a survey from start to finish to understand the socio-cultural importance of this historical venue to people of Rifle. In designing the survey flyer and in-person questionnaires, I finally made use of the many hours of my time I spent in high school learning how to use Photoshop. Ex-post, I was humbled to find many free websites online could have probably designed the flyers better.
