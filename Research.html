          <div class="paper-title">What Happens When We Pay Our Teachers More? Evidence from New Jersey Public Schools</div>
          <div class="abstract">
          The idea of increasing teacher salary to improve student performance has long been a major discussion in education policy. However, there is yet no consensus on the impact of teacher salary on improving student performance. This paper attempts to answer this question by analyzing whether school districts with higher teacher salaries have better student outcomes. By taking school level student performance data from 2003 through 2018, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach that exploits the variation in teacher salaries due to a bargaining effort called ”50K The First Day” that pushed school districts to adopt a salary floor for new ”inexperienced” teachers. We first show how this act increased the difference in salaries between the treated and control groups for not only new teachers but also experienced teachers and find that increases in teacher salary increased student outcomes. We also discuss the mechanism through which these differences could have been observed.

          <div class="paper-title">Bridging the Gap to Access? Impact of Pre-Collegiate Summer Program on College Outcomes</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            U.S. colleges have an inequity problem and even when minority students do attend college, African Americans and Hispanic/Latino students have been found to be two of the most under-performing groups. In that regard, several colleges have adopted several strategies to first increase the diversity of the students in their college and second to ensure these students end up successfully graduating from college. This paper looks at one such program carried out by the Access Center at Colorado State University called the Bridge Scholars Program - a program designed to assist students, especially those from first-generation and limited income households, in making a successful transition to college by offering an eight-week summer program the summer before they start their freshman year. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRDD) approach under a local randomization assumption, we find positive effects of the program on several college outcomes. We also discuss the mechanism through which such observed positive effects occur.

          <div class="paper-title">How Much Did COVID Impact College Outcomes for High-Schoolers Studying Remote?</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            Building upon the existing literature that has shown that COVID had negative impacts on high-school outcomes, we can expect COVID to have had some negative repercussions on college outcomes of affected high-school students as well. This paper answers the question by analyzing whether studying under remote settings in high school had any impacts on college outcomes. Using a standard Differences-in-Differences (DiD) model, we find no meaningful differences in the impact of studying online during high school on college outcomes as measured through college GPA and major choices.

              <br> This paper initially started out during my second year of undergraduate when I was taking econometrics and got me interested in time-series analysis. My research in graduate school has drifted away from this I remain interested in this area.

          <div class="paper-title">Agricultural conservation networks in Iowa</div>
          <div class="abstract">
            This is an example of a project I was part of for my work at IRISS where we used social network analysis to figure out how connections amongst farmers explain their working pattern. The project was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund. A lot of the social network stuff did not end up in this report but I am really enjoy working on these type of analysis and hope to incorporate network analysis in my future works. <br> Iowa's farmlands, celebrated for their remarkable agricultural productivity, are facing pressing environmental challenges, including soil erosion, waterway nitrogen pollution, and vulnerability to extreme weather events. These issues imperil the state's agricultural sector's long-term sustainability and economic stability. Despite substantial investments from governmental and non-governmental entities to encourage conservation practice use, adoption rates remain persistently low. In this report, we use quantitative, qualitative, and social network analysis on a sample of 38 farmers to understand how social networks shape their adoption of conservation practices. We analyze data through a systems framework and compare counties with high- and low-adoption of conservation practices to assess influences from the individual farmer level to the broader societal context. We conclude with a discussion of strategic implications to promote conservation adoption.
