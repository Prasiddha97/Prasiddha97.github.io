        <p>I'm Sid- and economist currently working on areas of education and labor. I hold a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University. My dissertation focused on the economics of education. I am currently working for the Division of Strategy and Policy at the University of North Carolina System Office where I am part of some really cool higher-ed research projects. More details about my research can be found on my <a href="Research.html" >Research</a> page.</p>
          <p>I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from RCNJ where I also minored in Computer Science, Economics and International Studies. I also did a lot of quantitative work for the Institute for Research in Social Science (IRISS) at CSU which has further strengthened my belief that we need to incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach to better address questions that have hughe policy implications. I consider health and education to be the two most important areas a country should have good control over and thus am greatly interested in policy issues in these two areas since the status of these two sectors, in my opinion, largely dictates the quality of life citizens in those countries have.</p>
          <p>I am currently trying to find datasets that look at how specific work profession dynamics within a household affect mental health with a key focus on pre/postpartum depression. If you are someone interested in this type of work, please feel free to email me at pshakya "AT" northcarolina "dOt" edu and we can have a chat!</p>
