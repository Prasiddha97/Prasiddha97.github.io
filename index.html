          <p>I am a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at Colorado State University (CSU) currently researching on topics pertaining to economics of health and education. My dissertation basically focuses on two different areas of interest: one area is the impacts of TRIO-funded programs on college outcomes for first-generation students here in the US. The other chapter/s (still working on it!) looks at possible social remittances from migration in Nepal and India. For this, I am utilizing the DHS surveys to evaluate whether having someone you know abroad changes behaviors of households back home. </p>
          <p>I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from RCNJ where I also minored in Computer Science and Economics. I think this has led me to be a huge proponent of interdisciplinary research and my research aims to utilize tools from various disciplines outside of those used in the "traditional" Econ literature. I also do a lot of quantitative work of the Institute for Reseach in Social Science (IRISS) at CSU which has further strengthened my believe that we need to incorporate multi-disciplinary approach to address questions in developmental economics and economics of health and educations (areas I am primarily interested in).</p>
          <p>I am currently actively trying to find datasets that look at whether family structure/work professions have significant impact on both pre and post partum depression rates in developed countries. If you are someone interested in this type of work, please feel free to email me at pshakya "AT" colostate "dOt" edu and we can have a chat!</p>
