        <p>I'm Sid - an economist currently working on areas of education and labor. I hold a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University. My dissertation focused on the economics of education. I am currently working for the Division of Strategy and Policy at the University of North Carolina System Office where I am part of some really cool higher-ed research projects. More details about my research can be found on my <a href="Research.html">Research</a> page.</p>
        <p>I am currently trying to find datasets that look at how specific work profession dynamics within a household affect mental health with a key focus on pre/postpartum depression. If you are someone interested in this type of work, please feel free to email me at pshakya "AT" northcarolina "dOt" edu and we can have a chat!</p>
